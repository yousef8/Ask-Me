# Ask Me

![Ask Me logo](./assets/AskMe.png)

This is the third project of the [Mastering 4 critical SKILLS using C++17 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-4skills/).

It is a simple CLI file-base replica of the famous Ask.fm app.

## Installation

- This is a c++ program so you will need to have c++ installed on your system.

- You will need a compiler of some sort to compile and build the program for me I used `gcc`.

- You can compile this app using `gcc` by running the following command:

      g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -g askMe.cpp -o askMe

## Development

This app was developed and tested on :

- [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux.

- vs code

- `gcc` as compiler

- `gdb` as debugger

## TO-DO

- [ ] Refactor User and User DB structs
- [ ] Refactor app structure
- [ ] Make the app read last IDs from the DB file and not from separate file
- [ ] Make one DB instance for the AskMe struct
